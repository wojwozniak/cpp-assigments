# cpp-assigments
Most of code I created while I was preparing for matura exam, and then from basic CPP courses at uni.
Almost all of it was "make it work, not look good" under time pressure so it is quite ugly XD
### Some more info
Im uploading everything at once because I didn't know about github when I was working on it.
- Matura prep - worked on it from 11-2020 to 05-2021. It isn't named with any convention, there are solutions to almost every CS matura exam since 2015 and to most of training assigments from Central Examination Board
- Programming 101 - from 10-2021 to 01-2022 (most of this course isn't here because site where we were uploading assigments got wiped when new semester started :(
- OOP 101 - from 02-2022 to 06-2022
